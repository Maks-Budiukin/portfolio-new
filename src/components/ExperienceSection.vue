                                <p>At GoToInc, I worked as a front-end developer specializing in Vue 3. I utilized Pinia
                                    for efficient state management across our applications. One of my key projects
                                    involved developing a robust application using Nuxt.js. I created and maintained
                                    various UI components to ensure a cohesive user experience. My responsibilities
                                    included designing and developing landing pages that effectively communicated our
                                    products. I built a fully functional shopping cart system to enhance the e-commerce
                                    capabilities of our platform. I developed a comprehensive user dashboard, providing
                                    users with a seamless and intuitive interface. My work also involved creating an
                                    audio player that integrated smoothly with our application. Collaborating with
                                    designers and backend developers, I ensured that our projects met high-quality
                                    standards. My time at GoToInc significantly improved my skills in front-end
                                    development and teamwork. </p>

                                <p>After completing my training, I transitioned to freelancing as a full-stack
                                    developer. During this period, I successfully completed several projects utilizing a
                                    diverse range of technologies. I worked extensively with MongoDB and MSSQL for
                                    database management, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval. For backend
                                    development, I primarily used Express and Nest.js, creating robust and scalable
                                    server-side applications. On the frontend, I employed React and Redux to build
                                    dynamic, state-driven user interfaces. My JavaScript skills were crucial in adding
                                    interactivity and functionality across all projects. One of my significant freelance
                                    projects involved developing a complex e-commerce platform, integrating both
                                    frontend and backend seamlessly. I also worked on a project management tool,
                                    enhancing its user interface and adding real-time collaboration features. I
                                    collaborated with other developers on some projects, which improved my teamwork and
                                    communication skills. My role often required me to wear multiple hats, from
                                    designing database schemas to deploying applications. I took on full responsibility
                                    for the entire development lifecycle, from initial requirement gathering to final
                                    deployment. My freelance experience honed my problem-solving abilities and taught me
                                    to work efficiently under tight deadlines. I implemented best practices in coding,
                                    ensuring that all my projects were maintainable and scalable. Working independently
                                    and in teams allowed me to adapt quickly to different work environments and project
                                    requirements. This freelance journey significantly enriched my skill set and
                                    prepared me for more challenging roles in full-stack development. </p>

                                <p>I completed a one-year full-stack developer course at GoIT, where I gained
                                    comprehensive knowledge in web development. Throughout the course, I worked on six
                                    educational projects that spanned various technologies. I started with HTML and CSS
                                    to build responsive and visually appealing web pages. My training included extensive
                                    JavaScript programming to add interactivity and functionality to the web
                                    applications. I developed projects using React, which allowed me to create dynamic
                                    and efficient user interfaces. For state management, I utilized Redux to ensure the
                                    applications were scalable and maintainable. On the backend, I learned to use
                                    Node.js and Express to create robust server-side applications. My projects also
                                    involved working with MongoDB, where I handled data storage and retrieval
                                    efficiently. The hands-on experience of building these projects solidified my
                                    understanding of the full-stack development process. Completing the course at GoIT
                                    equipped me with the skills needed to develop comprehensive web applications from
                                    scratch.
